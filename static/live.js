/* The live lesson page.
 *
 * Two editors, stacked. The upper one mirrors whatever the teacher is typing
 * in their own PyIDE tab; the lower one is the student's, and they type the
 * lesson out themselves.
 *
 * THE ONE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS TO KEEP
 *
 *   Nothing that arrives from the network is ever written into the student's
 *   editor. Not on a poll, not on a reconnect, not when the lesson ends.
 *   `mirror` is the only CodeMirror this file ever calls setValue on, and
 *   `mine` is the only one the student types in. A class losing their own
 *   work because the teacher pressed a key is the failure that would stop
 *   anyone using this a second time, so it is arranged to be impossible
 *   rather than carefully avoided.
 *
 *   There is deliberately no button that copies the teacher's code down.
 *   Typing it is the exercise.
 *
 * WHY POLLING AND NOT A WEBSOCKET
 *
 *   WebIDE runs on `gunicorn --workers 2`. A socket lives inside one worker,
 *   so broadcasting across both would need a message broker — another Render
 *   service, another bill. A row in the Postgres that is already there costs
 *   nothing new, and the poll below asks "has the version changed?" and is
 *   answered 304 almost every time.
