/* WebIDE — rendered markdown notes.
 *
 * A .md file in a project is class notes: it renders in the right pane rather
 * than opening as text. The markdown source is only editable while authoring a
 * new project, so a student opening a shared link (or forking it) sees the
 * notes but cannot edit them or trip over a tab full of raw markdown.
 *
 * Everything a student could author gets sanitized before it reaches the page.
 * This is the only place in the app where stored content becomes HTML rather
 * than text, so it is the only place injection is possible.
