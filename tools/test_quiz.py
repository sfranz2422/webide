"""Questions in the notes: the format, the key kept off the wire, and the marks.

    python3 tools/test_quiz.py

A teacher writes a ```quiz block in an assignment's notes; students answer it
once, on the page, and are told at once whether they were right; the points
go on top of the teacher's score and Sync sends the two together.

WHAT IS ACTUALLY BEING GUARDED

  The answer key never reaches a student.
      The notes are copied into every student's draft and ride on every live
      push, so a key left in them is a key anyone can read in the page
      source. It is taken out at each exit, and a missed exit leaks it with
      no sign at all — the page looks exactly the same. So every exit is
      opened here as a student and searched for the key. A new route that
      hands an assignment's files out needs a check in that section.

  One try.
      The second answer to a question is refused, and the reply is the first
      one's result. Two quick clicks across two workers cannot both count.

  The browser reads a block exactly as the server does.
      quiz.parse and notes.js's parseQuiz are two copies of one reader. If
      they disagree, the question shown is not the question marked. node runs
      the browser's copy on the same blocks.

  The grade is the score plus the questions.
      On the dashboard, in what Sync sends, and on the student's My work page.
