"""WebIDE, teaching live: the mirror, and what could quietly ruin a lesson.

    python3 tools/test_live.py

A live lesson is thirty people watching one row in a table. Almost everything
that can go wrong with it goes wrong SILENTLY — the page still renders, the
button still says Live, and the only symptom is a class looking at a line
their teacher fixed two minutes ago. So each of those is a check here.

WHAT IS ACTUALLY BEING GUARDED

  A student's own work is never touched.
      The page has two editors. If anything arriving from the network could
      reach the lower one, a class would lose a paragraph of their own typing
      the moment the teacher pressed a key, and nobody would use this twice.
      Checked by reading live.js: the mirror is the only editor given a value.

  A push that arrives late cannot win.
      The teacher's browser sends every 400ms. On school wifi two of those
      can overtake each other, and without a guard the OLDER text lands with
      the NEWER version number — after which nothing corrects it until the
      next keystroke. The write is conditional on a stamp that only goes up.

  A student who joins late is not left behind.
      No catch-up path, no replay: the first poll carries the whole file.

  Nothing lives in memory.
      Every one of these apps runs `gunicorn --workers 2`. A dict in a module
      is visible to one worker and invisible to the other, and which one a
      student reaches changes from poll to poll. It would pass every test on
      a laptop running a single worker and fail in front of a class.

  Only the host can type into the lesson.
      Checked against the row, not against the teacher list — a second
      teacher must not be able to write into somebody else's lesson.
