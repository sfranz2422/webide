"""Lessons: notes and questions with no code, for classes that are not
programming.

    python3 tools/test_lesson.py

A lesson is an assignment with kind "lesson" and its notes in lesson.md, so
the quiz, the dashboard, Classroom and the live link work on it as they do
on any assignment. What this guards is where a lesson must differ.

WHAT IS ACTUALLY BEING GUARDED

  The class never gets the answers.
      The notes go to students on the lesson page and on every live push.
      Both are searched for the key. The teacher's own page keeps it.

  A lesson is its own page, and nothing of the code editor's.
      The assignment link opens the lesson for a student and the lesson's
      editor for its teacher; Edit and the dashboard's Go live go there too;
      the code editor's Go live chooser does not offer it.

  Live follows the teacher; the assignment link does not.
      The same page, told which: from the live link it is given the lesson's
      code and polls; from the assignment link it is given none.

  Turn in is what counts.
      It makes a Submission with no snapshot, the teacher sees each
      student's answers in place of an Open link, and Sync sends the points.
