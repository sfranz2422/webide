"""A student's My work page, and the one button each student gets.

    python3 tools/test_my_work.py

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS

Assignments and saved projects are both drafts underneath, and the window
that listed them showed every draft the same way. A student who pressed Save
and then Turn in on a live lesson saw what looked like two things — a saved
project and a turned-in one — when it was one row all along. And the toolbar
offered Save, Share and Turn in side by side, so which one hands work in was
a question every student had to answer.

So this pins:

  * /my lists an assignment ONCE, under Assignments, with where it stands,
    however the student came to it (handout link, live lesson, or both), and
    lists under Projects only what is not for an assignment;
  * work turned in stays listed after the working copy is deleted, because
    it is still the teacher's;
  * each kind of student gets one thing to press: Turn in on an assignment,
    Save otherwise, Sign in and Share when signed out;
  * a live lesson for an assignment has Turn in and no Save.
