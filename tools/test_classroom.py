"""Connecting a teacher's Google Classroom, posting work there, sending grades.

    python3 tools/test_classroom.py

Needs `cryptography` (pip install -r requirements.txt): the stored token is
encrypted, and checking that is half the point of this file.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS

The connection is a credential that can post to a teacher's classes and
grade them, kept for weeks. The ways of getting it wrong are all quiet:

  * stored in the clear, a copy of the database is a key to every
    connected teacher's Classroom;
  * a teacher who unticks one box on Google's consent screen gets a token
    that works today and fails the day grades are sent;
  * a teacher who picks their personal Gmail from the account chooser
    connects classes that are not the ones they teach here;
  * a token Google has stopped honouring makes the dashboard fail the same
    way forever, unless it is forgotten so Connect is offered again;
  * a student must never be shown any of this.

Google is never called. `_google_post` and `_google_get` are the only two
functions in app.py that reach it, and both are replaced here.
